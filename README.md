# Chicago Face Database

### Description

The goal of this project was to understand which objective and subjective characteristics of a person's face are most highly correlated with perceived attractiveness.  This project started as a Tableau dashboard in early 2020 and I later recreated a lot of the same descriptive analyses in an R Shiny app with the addition of some predictive analytics later in the year.

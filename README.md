### History

This project started as a Tableau dashboard in early 2020 and I later recreated a lot of the same descriptive analyses in an R Shiny app with the addition of some predictive analytics later in the year.

## Challenges

While the researchers who conducted this analysis took steps to mitigate bias based on race and sex, it is impossible to completely eliminate it.  I placed a few notes in the dashboard stating I was not advocating that certain results indicate a specific race or sex was more attractive, but that the perception of attractiveness depends on race and sex for this dataset.  

If I were to conduct this analysis from scratch, I would first randomize the sex and race of participants for a judge to rate as well as increase the number of judges in order to dilute the bias as much as possible.
